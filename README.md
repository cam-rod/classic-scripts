# Classic Script

This repository contains a collection of programs I've worked on in the past. Among the more powerful programs are [Total Days](https://github.com/cam-rod/classic-scripts/tree/master/TotalDays)  (which calculates the number of days between two dates, leap years included) and [Simple Calculator](https://github.com/cam-rod/classic-scripts/tree/master/summer-sheets/simplecalculator) (which performs basic arithmetic calculations with direct text input). Open a folder to get a README on what it contains.
